# Java-Programming-Arrays-Lists-and-Structured-Data
My projects for the Coursera course Java Programming: Arrays, Lists and Structured Data by Duke University

## Week 1 - Basic Cryptography, Breaking the Caesar Cipher and Object-Oriented Caesar Cipher
In this module, I've learned about the basics of cryptography, the science of keeping information private and secure.
As a final project, I've created OOCaesarCipher, an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting or unshifting the alphabet.
To solve these problems, I've worked more with processing Strings, but I also learned about arraysâ€”a way to store an indexable sequence of elements.

Acquired Skills:
1. Combine Strings using concatenation
2. Build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder
3. Use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data
4. Refactor your programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles
5. Practice effective algorithm design
