macbeth my dearest love duncan comes here tonight
lady macbeth and when goes hence
macbeth tomorrow as he purposes
lady macbeth o never
shall sun that morrow see
your face my thane is as a book where men
may read strange matters to beguile the time
look like the time bear welcome in your eye
your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
but be the serpent under it he thats coming
must be provided for and you shall put
this nights great business into my dispatch
which shall to all our nights and days to come
give solely sovereign sway and masterdom
macbeth we will speak further
